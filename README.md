The main aim of "SlackBuild Automate" is to help the user in installing packages through the prebuilt scripts avaialable on https://slackbuilds.org/ , so that most of the procedure itself would be executed by the script.
It is written in bash so nothing particual, as of now the user must install the built package with the installpkg command. 
The packages are located in the /tmp folder.
"SlackBuild Automate" does not help the user with dependencies as those would still have to be manually managed by the system administrator, as in the usual Slackware manner.
